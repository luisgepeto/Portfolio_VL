## How much energy is consumed while you are choosing your favorite frozen product?
We are not always conscious about the energy consumption behind our choices. In this video I explain how many kWh are consumed for every minute that you leave a freezer door open at the supermarket.

## Is it possible to scape through a ventilation duct?
In this video I analyze whether John McClane could have scaped through the ventilation ducts of the Nakatomi Plaza building (Die Hard). I go over an engineering analysis using ASHRAE Fundamentals 2009 and determine the air flowing through a duct with the appropriate size. We calculate the equipment capacity (TR) and analyze the different common systems in high rise buildings while going over some energy efficiency remarks.
